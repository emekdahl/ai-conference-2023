## Notes

# 500 years of media technology

- thesis: we're witnessing a technology (GenAI) that will become the most critical media technology

## Video Games are the next most significant medium by some measures

- immersive
- Gen AI is going to be more immersive
- a medium that will help us solve problems and engages
- It will mostly add, not replace (we'll still have books)
- What will it look like?
	- most of them haven't yet been invented
## ACE Demo

- demo with LLM, AS, TSS in the Omniverse
	- powered by an Nvidia NeMo LLM and DLSS
	- Guardrails and steering make it more useful
- talking to the NPC is fun! 
	- the speaker felt a real connection to him that he'd never yet had with an NPC
- LLMs with different personalities and skills will change gaming
- The user interface of GenAI looks like the Omniverse
	- virtual worlds that are entirely immersive
Virtual people are among the most exciting and valuable things we could build with GenAI!

## Nvidia DLSS

- they already have a video generation model that is generating images in over 400 computer games
- An AI generates most pixels
- we did traditional graphics to make 1 pixel, then genAI to generate 8 pixels
- makes the GPU 5x more efficient because the model learns from the video signal
- not only is it more efficient, but it is also more beautiful
	- GenAI makes virtual worlds look better (rendering)


## Generative AI new tools for the most critical work we do

- Education: tutoring, feedback, question exploration
- healthcare: flowchart, drug discovery, analysis
- biology: genomics, protein structures
- agriculture: data analysis, sensing, robotics
- programming: debugging, documenting, scaffolding

## Post-scarcity Economy

For example, why do people continue to play the piano when there's so much recorded piano music they could never get through in a lifetime?
	- When we have GenAI for piano music, people will still play the piano because it is more about the content or the quality of the experience
- we already have a post-scarcity economy for some things already
- post-scarcity economies are about quality rather than quantity
- Gen AI will give us a post-scarcity economy for more things
- Content matters more than form

## Towards an Artificial Specific Intelligence

- human general intelligence is foundational but not sufficient
- humans use specialization to solve problems
	- that's what education is about
- AI also needs specialization

### Philosophy

- unique values, unique purpose
	- we know that large groups of people tend to have different values, so alignment will need to be specialized
- a.k.a. alignment

### Perspective

- unique perspectives solve problems
- every company is built around a secret
- the world's most important data is its most confidential data
	- For example, medical records
- that's why we need models with specialized perspectives based on the datasets they are trained on

### Position

- it is not enough to know something. You need to do something to change the world
- the platform a model uses to solve a problem is critical

## Nvidia Picasso

- foundry for custom Gen AI models for visual design

## Towards a Specific Intelligence: Getty Images

- Getty Images made a Gen AI model using Picasso trained on their images
- safe by construction, artists get paid licensing revenues
- Getty leverages their unique philosophy, perspective, and position to make their own Gen AI products
- this is an excellent example of specific intelligence

## NeMo - Designed for Enterprise Specialization

- allows organizations to build and deploy their own language models and deploy them
	- can use foundation models
	- run on Nvidia data centers
- model customization for LLMs
	- RHLF
	- prompt learning
	- supplemental fine-tuning

### NeMo Guardrails

- describes soft boundaries for how an LLM should work 
- guidelines, not decision tree
- safety
- security

## Gen AI: The most critical compute problem

- incredible speedups take more than just powerful chips
- The entire stack must be co-optimized
	- chips, systems, frameworks, compilers, algorithms, apps
- this is mostly software work; in fact, most of the people at Nvidia don't work on chips
- Nvidia does a lot of this work themselves because no one will care more than they do about optimizing their own software for their own hardware
- gpt3 175B parameters and 323 zettaflops - think about the kind of scaling that has occurred since AlexNet in 2012

### Nvidia Hardware: The Modern AI Factory

- GPUs are connected and can talk to one another at 900 GB / sec
- then, they are packaged up into a system that they call "one giant GPU"
	- can read or write from any of the GPUs, which is why they call it that
- put all that in a box, 32 petaflops/sec
- then the boxes go into a network
- then into racks, and then into a datacenter

## Conclusion

- the next medium 
- the scope of applications will be much broader than entertainment or video games
- will expand the post-scarcity economy
- AI is made in a factory, an accelerated data center, that will enable organizations to create specialized AI

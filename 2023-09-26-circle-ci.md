# Out of the Lab and into the Product

## AI Summary

The notes discuss Rob Zuber's insights on the growth and challenges of AI/ML projects in the context of CircleCI.

#### Key Points:

- **Growth of AI/ML**: The industry is moving from enabling technologies to specialized technologies for end-users, described as the "Sequoia Act 2 of AI."
    
- **Impact on Product Behavior**: AI fundamentally alters how products behave and what users expect from them.
    
- **Unique Challenges**:
    - **Researchers**: Face pressures to commercialize and must consider how to mitigate risks when transitioning from a controlled environment to a commercial product.
    - **Product Builders**: Must adapt to the non-deterministic nature of AI products.
- **AI Customer Experiences**: There's a need to synthesize what is known from lab research with real-world product experiences.
    
- **Existing Competencies**: The industry already has the skills and technology needed to build excellent AI-driven customer experiences.
    

The notes suggest that the challenge lies not in the technology itself, but in adapting existing skills and paradigms to the unique demands of AI/ML products.

## Notes

## Growth of AI / ML Projects on CircleCI

- Sequoia Act 2 of AI
	- transition from all of the things we've built as enabling technologies to specialized technologies for end users

## AI fundamentally changes the way we think about product behavior and expectations

## Unique challenges

- researchers
	- pressure to commercialize
	- how do I mitigate the risk of releasing a product that was developed in a carefully controlled environment
- product builders
	- paradigm shift to non-determinism

## Amazing AI Customer Experiences

- everything we know about what happens in the lab
- everything we know about what happens in the product

### We already have what we need

- we have decades of competency in building great customer experiences, existing tech, and things that are being made

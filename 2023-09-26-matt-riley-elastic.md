# Unlocking Relevance with Large Language Models

## AI Summary

The notes discuss the importance of search technologies, particularly Elasticsearch, in the context of General AI (Gen AI).

#### Key Points:

- **Search Evolution**: Customer expectations for search are rapidly evolving to include natural language queries, nuance, and interpretation.
    
- **Role in Gen AI**: Great search experiences are crucial for successful Gen AI applications. They often require integrating private data and retrieval technology with Gen AI models.
    
- **Importance of Retrieval Tech**: It enhances user experience by making search more engaging and context-rich. It also helps control costs and reduce hallucinations in the AI responses.
    
- **Retrieval Augmented Search with Elasticsearch**: Vector search is just the starting point. Additional features like specialized filtering and faceting are essential for a great customer experience.
    
- **Elasticsearch Relevance Engine**: Provides text and hybrid vector search, offers a choice of machine learning models, and is enterprise-ready for developers.
    

The notes emphasize that Elasticsearch can be a powerful tool for enhancing Gen AI applications, going beyond simple vector search to provide a rich, engaging, and cost-effective user experience.

## Notes

- elastic is one of the most widely adopted open-source search technologies
- How do search engines fit in the overall Gen AI ecosystem

## Search is rapidly evolving
- as are customer expectations around how we query
	- natural language
	- nuance
	- interpretation
- examples
	- almost all include proprietary data that wouldn't be included in the foundation model

## Great search is critical for great Gen AI experiences

- build a bridge between
	- private data
	- retrieval technology
	- gen AI

## Why does retrieval tech matter?

- great user experience
	- build engaging search enriched by your private data and context
- control costs and hallucinations
- enterprise toolkits for developers
	- not just vector search, specialized filtering, and faceting

## Retrieval Augmented Search with Elasticsearch 

- vector search is only a starting point
- filtering and faceting is critical to great CX

## Elasticsearch Relevance Engine for AI apps

- text, hybrid vector search
- choice of machine learning models
- Enterprise-ready developer experience

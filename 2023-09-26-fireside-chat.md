# Fireside Chat with Erik Brynjolfsson

## AI Summary


The notes cover a Fireside Chat with Erik Brynjolfsson and DJ Patil, focusing on the impact of AI on the job market, public trust, and future goals for machine learning.

#### Key Points:

- **Job Market**: Brynjolfsson argues that concerns over job losses due to AI are misplaced. He suggests that productivity growth could double to 3% and that 80% of the economy, especially knowledge work, will be affected positively.
    
- **Cresta Rollout**: An example of a Gen AI system in a call center showed that the least skilled operators benefited the most. It also indicated that these workers retained some skills even when the system crashed.
    
- **Public Trust**: A Gallop Poll indicates skepticism about technology companies using AI responsibly. While Brynjolfsson acknowledges disruption, he doesn't foresee massive unemployment but rather significant shifts in job roles.
    
- **Turing Trap**: The debate should not focus on whether machines can perfectly imitate humans but on how AI can augment human capabilities.
    
- **Task Analysis**: Brynjolfsson highlights an initiative called WorkHelix that identifies 19,000 distinct tasks across more than 900 occupations. The goal is to understand how AI can assist or augment each specific task.
    
- **Macro Trends**: The conversation should move from holding back AI to embracing it for productivity and societal benefits. Brynjolfsson cites recent strikes in the screenwriting and car manufacturing sectors as examples of the growing influence of AI.
    

The overarching theme is that AI should be seen not as a threat but as a tool for augmentation and productivity enhancement, necessitating shifts in tasks and roles rather than causing large-scale unemployment.

## Notes

## Intro

- Historically, we talked about jobs that were going to disappear. How should we be thinking about this now?

### Productivity Prognostication

- EB says double productivity growth (3%) - he thinks the government is being far too conservative in the predictions
- 80% of the economy will be affected (knowledge work, a set of workers that weren't that affected by the early waves of automation)
- new technology seems to have the ability to help lower-skilled workers

## Cresta Rollout Example

- Gen AI rollout in a massive call center
- phased rollout, which allowed them to do causal inference
- everyone benefitted significantly, but the least skilled and least experienced operators had the most benefit 
- the LLM looked at the transcripts and captured the tacit knowledge and their relation to the outcomes
- the system also crashed, so the research looked at what happened when it crashed - the less skilled workers, even when the system wasn't available, had absorbed some of the tacit knowledge and were performing better than baseline (though not as good as when the system was available)

## Gallop Poll

- A sizeable percentage do not believe technology companies can be trusted to utilize AI to the benefit of the American public

### Response

- we do expect disruption, and we do need to plan for it
- not foreseeing massive unemployment but massive shifts

## Turing Trap

- we are getting pretty close to having machines that perfectly imitate humans
- HOWEVER, is this the right goal?
	- imitating humans is, in some ways, a low ceiling because we have particular idiosyncrasies and limitations
	- in other ways, a high or nonsensical ceiling, then maybe getting a machine to pick up a dime
- we should be aiming for augmentations or complements, or AI that improves the productivity of humans
	- rather than replacements, which will reduce the value of those works
	- we hope that the augmentation strategy will share the AI prosperity, whereas replacements will consolidate wealth among the owners of the AI systems

## Task Analysis for > 900 Occupations

- 19k distinct tasks 
	- WorkHelix - identify distinct tasks so that companies have a roadmap to apply AI to distinct tasks in their company
- measure AI against the task, not against humans
	- ask: how can technology assist or augment a particular task
- GPTs
	- look specifically at tasks affected by GenAI
	- find a roadmap for the task that will be most immediately affected by AI

## Macro-Trends

- culture/conversation themes
	- hold it back or stop it - doesn't work and is not a realistic goal
	- historically, America has been successful by being flexible and embracing technological change
- The first one of two strikes was resolved yesterday. One of the core components was around AI
	- screenwriters
	- car manufacturers
- specific example: professor
	- holds students to a higher standard, assuming they will be leveraging AI technologies

## AI Summary

The notes discuss the evolution and future of automated programming, particularly the integration of AI tools in the software development process.

#### Key Points:

- **Evolution of Programming**: The focus has shifted from optimizing hardware in the 1970s to optimizing programmers in the 2000s, and now towards assisting users. The types of problems being tackled have also grown in complexity, from simple to "wicked problems."
    
- **Historical Milestones**:
    
    - 1950s: Basic machine operation
    - 1978: Introduction of C language
    - 2014: Advent of Jupyter, Python, and Numpy, aiming to make humans more efficient
    - 2023: Most software engineers are now using AI-assisted programming tools like OpenAI's Codex and Copilot
- **Current Uses of Automated Programming**:
    
    - API lookup and pair-programming are common.
    - Problem-solving is a significant use-case.
    - A challenge lies in training AI models on code datasets that contain both good and bad code.
- **Future of Automated Programming**:
    
    - Beyond coding, automated programming will extend to documentation, maintenance, design, deployment, testing, and strategy.

The Stack Overflow survey indicates that over 85% of developers are already using AI tools for coding, underscoring the growing importance of automated programming.

## Notes

- A stack overflow survey said > 85% of developers are using AI tools to write code

## Intro & Lookback


1970s > 2000s > 2020s
optimize hardware > optimize programmer > assist users
low level code > high level code > dialog
simple problems > complex problems > wicked problems
ad hoc > mathematical / logical > natural science / empirical
on your own > standard methodology > executable methodology

- 1950s - just making the machine work
- 1978 - C programming language invented
- 2014 - jupyter, python, numpy - focused more on making humans more efficient rather than hardware
- 2023 - copilot openai codex - most SWEs using AI-assisted programming

## How is Automated Programming Used Today?

- API lookup / pair-programming
- Problem solving
- problem: training on a dataset where there is much code but also much bad code

## How Will Automated Programming Be Used Tomorrow

- documentation
- maintenance
- design
- deployment
- testing
- strategy
- programming will be only one of the tasks
